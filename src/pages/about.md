ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm Deepak Kewadia, a Software Engineer by day, and a Fooseballer by night.

My journey into Coding started when I installed linux on my old machine, after that i didn't stop and now i am here; running a blog site ðŸ˜Ž.

I thrive on solving complex problems with simple solutions. I'm particularly interested in Python and AI/ML, Golang and microservices and Open-Source.

Outside of work, I'm a big fan of fooseball. These activities often fuel my creativity and help me see things from different perspectives.
